Short post.  Just wanted to announce that the blog now has comments thanks to [Giscus](https://giscus.app/).  I was inspired by Alex/IronicBadger talking about it in [his blog](https://blog.ktz.me/dump-disqus-for-giscus/) and also on the [Self Hosted podcast](https://selfhosted.show/86).  I always wanted a comment system but did not want to use Disqus for a variety of reasons.  Alex's lastest discovery was just icing on the cake.

Anyway, Giscus uses Github Discussions to create comment threads on posts.  Since I already used Github for this blog, it was relatively easy to get set up.  So now there's comments! Yay!

Also, looking at how few articles I wrote this year I feel kinda sad.  But I was waiting to write a lot of things because I moved this year.  I wasn't really do anything new for the past few months as I was in a holding pattern until I got into the new place.  Now that I'm here and getting settled, I'll make some time to document the new toys and things I've got set up.  Expect more soon!
