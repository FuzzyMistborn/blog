First blog post.  Wheeeeeee.

I'm still not 100% sure what I'll use this for.  But I wanted to start trying to document some of the smart home/tech things I'm doing so I can 1) maybe help someone else out who is having a similar problem and 2) make a resource for myself in case I have to rebuild everything (really hoping that never happens!).

So expect some things about smart homes, some things about general Linux, more things about smart homes....maybe some other random things.  We'll just have to see won't we?
